This sample data has been captured with an ULPI in high-speed mode connected
in parallel to an Eye-Fi SD card reader. The data was captured using chipscope,
thus the sample depth is very limited (32k bytes).

In this case, it's enough for the initial enumeration and the first few
usbmass commands (INQUIRY at 13399, READ_FORMATTED_CAPACITY at 114564 with
no response within this trace).

Probably due to a bug in the capture code, two transfers appear to be
corrupted:

- the DATA0 packet starting at sample 5559 is aborted early
- the DATA0 packet starting at sample 6735 is aborted early

Further, at the beginning there are a few invalid bytes, probably as part of
the noise when the USB device was plugged in.

There are no timestamps, only sample counts. This is also a limitation of
hardware used to capture this data. (This will not be an issue with OV1).

usbmass_enum.txt is the raw data, as received from ULPI, slightly filtered
(no RXCMDs in the middle of a packet). Bracketed bytes indicate RXCMDs,
non-bracketed bytes are USB data. Data is annotated with a very simple USB
packet decoder.

usbmass_enum.pkt is the raw data converted into a format that can be read by
the Ellisys Visual USB software. Please do not use this software unless you
own Ellisys hardware! Note that again there are no timestamps, instead the
sample count is used as the time.
